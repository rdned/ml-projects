### Audience Heatmap Tracking

- Track individual heatmaps corresponding to individual faces in the audience during the opera
- Calculate embeddings for each tracked heatmap representing stochastic processes
- Extract stochastic processes that minimize noise while preserving emotional information related to emotions during listening

### Audio Embedding

- Calculate embeddings of the synchronized audio from the opera
- Model the audio embedding as a stochastic process capturing musical features influencing emotions

### Connecting Music and Emotions

- Implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to connect the stochastic processes from audience emotions and music
- Train the ANN to predict emotions from music features and previous emotional states
- Hypothesize causal influence of music on emotions based on prediction accuracy

### Explainable AI Analysis

- Apply explainable AI methods to the trained ANN
- Identify crucial input features (music or previous emotions) that drive emotion prediction
- Gain insights into how music influences emotional responses

## Expected Outcomes

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
- A robust model linking musical features to emotional reactions
- Understanding of temporal dynamics of emotions during live music
- Explainable insights into causal relationships between music and emotions
:::

## Future Work

- Extend to other music genres and live settings
- Incorporate physiological data for multimodal emotion analysis
- Refine models with larger datasets and advanced AI techniques
