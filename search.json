Specifically, Autoformer and Informer are hot candidates: they are both open source, available on HuggingFace Hub of Git-based repos, and can be relatively easily adapted to our needs.\nNote that causal inference assumes unconfoundedness of the two processes. In general, unconfoundedness is a strong assumption necessary for making causal inferences. However, in our case, it is a reasonable assumption, excluding hidden variables that significantly influence both processes. For example, a potential confounder could be tiredness if it strongly impacts both the opera director/singers/musicians and the audience. In such case, we would need to adjust for it, which is a standard approach in causal inference from observational data.",
